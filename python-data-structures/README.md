## üí° Key Concepts

### Lists - Dynamic Arrays
```python
# List comprehension example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
# Result: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]

# Nested list comprehension
matrix = [[i+j for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]
# Result: [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]]
```

### Tuples - Immutable Sequences
```python
# Named tuple example
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(3, 4)
print(p.x, p.y)  # 3 4

# Tuple unpacking
coordinates = (10, 20)
x, y = coordinates
print(f"X: {x}, Y: {y}")  # X: 10, Y: 20
```

### Dictionaries - Hash Tables
```python
# Dictionary comprehension
word_counts = {'hello': 5, 'world': 3, 'python': 8}
filtered_counts = {word: count for word, count in word_counts.items() if count > 4}
# Result: {'hello': 5, 'python': 8}

# Default dictionary
from collections import defaultdict
dd = defaultdict(list)
dd['fruits'].append('apple')
dd['fruits'].append('banana')
# No need to check if key exists
```

### Sets - Unique Collections
```python
# Set operations
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

union = set1 | set2  # or set1.union(set2)
intersection = set1 & set2  # or set1.intersection(set2)
difference = set1 - set2  # or set1.difference(set2)

# Set comprehension
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
text = "hello world"
unique_vowels = {char for char in text if char in vowels}
# Result: {'e', 'o'}
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity Comparison

| Operation | List | Tuple | Dictionary | Set |
|-----------|------|-------|------------|-----|
| Access by index/key | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | N/A |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Insertion | O(1) | N/A | O(1) | O(1) |
| Deletion | O(n) | N/A | O(1) | O(1) |
| Append | O(1) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Memory Usage
```python
import sys

# Memory comparison
list_example = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
tuple_example = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
dict_example = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd', 5: 'e'}
set_example = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(f"List memory: {sys.getsizeof(list_example)} bytes")
print(f"Tuple memory: {sys.getsizeof(tuple_example)} bytes")
print(f"Dict memory: {sys.getsizeof(dict_example)} bytes")
print(f"Set memory: {sys.getsizeof(set_example)} bytes")
```

4. **Performance**: Choose appropriate data structures for your use case

### Debugging Tips
- Use `type()` to check data structure types
- Print data structure contents for debugging
- Use `sys.getsizeof()` to check memory usage
- Profile code performance with `timeit` module
